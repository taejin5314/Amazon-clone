# Project Name: Amazon Clone

This project is cloning Amazon website by using React.

## 1. Login Page

I used `firebase.auth()` using firebase package. `signInWithEmailAndPassword` made it easy to setting the login page much easier.

## 2. Register Page

## Firebase

Using firebase api from google so that makes it easy to handle database such as user information.
